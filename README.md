# Brian's brain (by Cyprien Bor√©e)

This project is an implementation of the cellular automaton called [Brian's Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain).
It's was developped solely by me with the [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) language and the [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan) graphics API.
