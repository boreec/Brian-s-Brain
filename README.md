# User manual

## Compilation

First of all you need to install rust language (see [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).

If you want to run the program in a GUI (a CLI version exists), you need to install the Vulkan API 
on your system (if you can run the test program `vkcube` it's good).

Additionally, you may need to install basic packages (`build-essential`, `cmake`) and also
others languages packages (`g++`, `python3`) required by dependencies.

Finally, you can build the program with `cargo`.
```console
user:$ cargo build --release 
```
